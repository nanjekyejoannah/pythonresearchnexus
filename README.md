# The Python Research Nexus

I have started this as a collection of both industry and academic reserach projects and work on the Python programming 
language and alternate implementations.

Free to create .md file and include a peer-reviewed paper and links to open source projects if any as a pull request. 
The project has one `.md` file but I will keep categorizing the work in different sections e.g `garbage collection`, 
`compilers` etc.

I plan to put this information on a web site in a more neat way.
